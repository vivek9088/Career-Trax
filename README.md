Internship Management System developed using C# windows application

#Project Introduction
The purpose of the project is to design and develop an Internship Management Information System (IMS) that will keep track of the students internship progress. That is, from application to internship completion. In addition, it will keep track of the progress for the rest of the students who do not follow the internship route and instead they are assigned a project with a faculty member or start their own company.
